<p>Established in 2014 by a husband and wife team of ice-cream fanatics, 
    Dragon Scoops has pledged to bring local, farm-fresh ingredients to the customer. 
    We make every effort to use only suppliers pledged to sustainable farming methods -
     even our napkins are 100% post-consumer waste. @*<a href="~/Views/Home/Contact.cshtml">Contact Us!</a>*@</p>
